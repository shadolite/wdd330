  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page
      <br>
      using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser
      <pre>const superman = document.getElementById('hero');
        const powers = superman.dataset.powers;
        << 'flight superSpeed'</pre>
        - Notice that the data- prefix is dropped. To access the attribute, 
        <br>
        powers is used as if it’s a property of the dataset object 
        <br>
        - If a data- attribute’s name contains hyphens
        <br>
        they are replaced with camel-case notation
        <br>
        so data-max-length would be accessed using dataset.maxLength
    </li>
    <li>
      localStorage
      <br>
      - Information stored is not shared with the server on every request
      <br>
      - Information is available in multiple windows of the browser if the domain is the same
      <br>
      - There is no actual storage capacity limit in the specification
      <br>
      but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain
      <br>
      - Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies
    </li>
    <li>
      The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications
      <br>
      - Before you can send notifications you need to get permission granted by the user
    </li>
